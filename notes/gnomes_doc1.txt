Gnomes Versus Troll


concept doc #Zer0!

Overall:   Intent is to a create a game similar to Plants .vs Zombies




Code Stuff:
 We're gonna use Unity, in full 3-d mode.  Display will likely be at 3/4, use little or no perspective.  We'll experiiment.
 


Initial Prototype.

 Let's make a simple grid, similar to PVZ
   5 rows,
   9 columns.  (let's keep these #'s flexible.  I'd like to consider super wide levels, that involve interesting camera angles.
   
   
 A "TRAY" of defensive objects.   For now, a shooter (think crossbow), and a spawner (think mushroom spawning puffball?)
  Player selects object to place, and places object.
  
 BADGUYS (trolls) will initially be walkers.  For now, randomly launched every X seconds on Row Y.
 
 Shooter will launch missile.
 
    So for now, 3-4 types of objects.   Long term we'll probably have more like 8ish.
	   Defensive objects (stuck in place)
	   Attackers (trolls)
	   Missiles - flying objects that collide with bad guys
	   And.... 
	     puffballs= the equivalent of sunshine in PVZ
=========
coding thoughts:

Every object should exist in 3space, with x,y,z coords, velocitys, and acceleration.
      We might not use the vertical coordinate for a bit, but it would be good to have.
	      (we eventually might do cool blimps or balloons)
		  
We should probably just use range checks for collision detection.  

We should PROBABLY avoid the Unity physics, but this can be discussed.  There may be cool things we can do,
 (such as hilly terrain).

Iniitally, let's build simple, clean, and small, but avoid "hard coding".
		  
=========
Graphics  - I need ideas from Brent on how to import graphics into Unity.  In the past, I used the sprites stuff - which might be ok.
 (And of course we imported full 3-d models into Spill)

=========
Audio - Peter's got an extensive library of usable sound effects, public  domain music, and skills to create more.

=========

What can we do better ?
