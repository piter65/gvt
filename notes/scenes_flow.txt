Scenes/States I can think of for GVT


#1.  Splash.   
   Will be nice graphic, copyright notice, loading, maybe credits.
   
   Hold for 5 seconds in normal mode, 1 second in developer mode.
   
#2.  Level Select.  
    For now, as simple as level 1-1, 1-2, 1-3,  or 2-1, 2-2, 2-3.
	    We may do something more creative down the road.
		
	Leave all open in developer mode, we'll work on some progression system for normal mode.
	
#3. Level Intro
    (No idea what we do here - PVZ has Crazy Dave give player hints.)

#4. Level Weapon Select.   
     (We may skip this for now, maybe forever)
	 
#5.  Game Play.  
     (We need to work on a system)
	     Player system almost working.  Collect dust.  Deploy gnomes.
		 Troll Systems needs some work.   
				We need system to launch trolls based on type, time, and location.
				(this needs to be mostly scripted) - we should discuss.
				
#6.  Game over.  Win or Lose.

#7.  Back to #2 -- Level Select.   (I think)
