Peter's Thoughts:


Types of gnomes/ gnome defenses:

#1. Crossbow Gnome - Most basic

#2. Catapult Gnome - Targets areas 4 blocks away or more.  Does bigger (double) damage.

#3. Pit Digger - Digs a pit, covers it with wood.  Kills one troll.

#4. AA Crossbow - Launches crossbow bolt higher in air.

#5. Oil Tower Gnome.  (Ok, this might be bad idea)-  Looks like seige tower, gnome can drop oil on trolls below.
 Very short distance defence.
 
#6. Ball and Chain Mace thrower.  

#7. Wood Sprocket thrower.  (similar to boomerang in PVZ2)

#8. Flame Thrower.   (3 tile damage zone?)

#9. Wicker/ Mesh Blocker.  (Equivalent to Potato blocker in PVZ)

#10. Water Pit?  Specifically for Fire Trolls?    (Water bucket Catapult?)

#11. Trebuchet - Just does lots of damage.  Maybe in 3 lanes?


-----------------
Ideas for Trolls.
 note: The main purpose of unique new trolls is to require unique new counter measures or strategies.
  (sounds obvious, but every cool troll should have a countermeasure.  
  In would be really cool if it would take two gnome structures for a countermeasure....   )
  
#1. Basic Troll.
#2. Two Headed Troll  - (twice the HP) - maybe 10% bigger.
#3.  Three Headed Troll (3x/4x HP??) - maybe 20% bigger.
 
#4. Toad Troll  - Does Pogo Stick type thing
#5. Shield Troll -  Resistant to crossbow.
#6. Duck and Run Troll -  Puts up shield, then runs to next square.
#7. Baloon Troll ?   (AIR TROLL?)
#8. Fire Troll


All for now.....







Brent's Thoughts:

- Trolls have a mutation/malformaty theme going on:
	- Multiple heads
	- Hunchbacks
	- Frog Hybrids
	- etc.
- Gnomes have an industry and ingenuity theeme going on.
	- They need to gather resources:
		- (Demolition) Chop/break down trees/rocks to clear room and obstructions.
		- (Earth) Dig a mine for iron and stone which can be hurled at trolls and used to build and ugrade things.
		- (Water) Dig a water well for water attacks.
		- (Fire) Dig an oil well for fire and oil slick attacks.
		- (Air) Build weather towers to harvest storm clouds for lightning and wind attacks.
		- etc.
	- They have enigeers that specialize in certain forms of construction/destruction:
		- Miner
			- Can dig mines at full speed.
			- Can repair mines at full speed.
			- Can break rocks at full speed.
			- (Can drill wells at half speed?)
		- Well Driller
			- Can drill wells at full speed.
			- Can repair/clean wells at full speed.
		- Carpenter
			- Can build windmills at full speed.
			- Can build fortifications at full speed.
			- Can chop down trees at full speed.
			- Can repair all constructions at full speed.
		- Meteorologist
			- Can build weather towers at full speed
			- Can repair weather towers at full speed
			- (Can command weather tower for building up super weapon attack?)
	- Gnome soldiers can harness resources to fuel their attacks:
		- Catapults and trebuchets can use stones for ammo.
		- Fire fighters can use water for ammo.
		- Flame throwers can use oil for ammo.
		- Tesla coils can use lightning/storm in a bottle for ammo.
